# Open Bash
Just some fun sample bash scripts. I've been using bash for 25 years and thought it would fun to create a public github repo of potentially useful scripts as and when I write them.  

## mnk_encrypt.sh
I wanted a wrapper script to help encrypt/decrypt files using openssl. 
**Make sure you have openssl installed before running the script.**
